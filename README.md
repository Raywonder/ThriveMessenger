# Thrive Messenger, chat like it's 2005!

## Introduction

Thrive Messenger is an instant messaging service that aims to bring back the speed, simplicity, fun and excitement of instant messengers from the 90s and 2000s, such as AIM, ICQ and MSN/Windows Live Messenger. It is not a revival project like [Escargot Chat](https://escargot.chat). Rather, it is an entirely new IM platform built from scratch. We're not reviving any old services, we're reviving the vibe of those services.

Part of the Thrive Essentials suite of software from G4p Studios, Thrive Messenger features a simplistic, accessible user interface that is easy to navigate and use for those who rely on screen readers such as [NVDA](https://nvaccess.org) and [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/). It achieves this with clear labels for UI elements, buttons, text fields, checkboxes etc, optional auto reading of new messages, and keyboard friendly navigation, allowing the user to use their arrow keys and the tab key to move around menus and other parts of the UI. Back in the day, this level of accessibility either required screen reader vendors to optimise their readers to work with the IM software, or third party scripts and screen reader add-ons from the blind community. Thrive Messenger is designed to be accessible by default, so the program works with the screen reader, not the other way round. Just how the 2000s should have been.

Thrive Messenger is open source, meaning anyone is free to download, view and modify the source code, and decentralised, meaning anyone can host their own Thrive Messenger Server.

## Client usage

### Accounts

In order to use Thrive Messenger, you will need a Thrive Messenger account. All you need for an account is a username which will be used to add you as a contact, an optional email address, and a strong password that nobody can guess.

You can create an account from the Thrive Messenger login dialog, or a server admin can create an account for you.

Please note: for both security and convenience, if the server you're using has SMTP enabled (see below), you are required to enter a valid email address when creating an account. This is so your account can be verified by email and you can easily reset your password if you forget it.

### Running from source

Note: these instructions are for running Thrive Messenger on Windows.
The Thrive Messenger client uses UV for dependency management. UV is a fast and reliable dependency and virtual environment manager for Python written in Rust. If you're a rust programmer or if you've ever compiled a Rust program, UV is basically Cargo for Python. It can even install Python for you if you don't have it already.

1. Make sure you have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) installed.
2. Press Windows + R, type powershell, and press Enter.
3. Run the following command in PowerShell to install UV.

    ```
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

4. Optionally, use UV to install Python.

    ```
    uv python install 3.13
    ```
5. Clone the GitHub repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/G4p-Studios/ThriveMessenger.git
    ```

6. Navigate to the ThriveMessenger directory.

    ```
    cd ThriveMessenger
    ```

7. Run install.cmd to install the required libraries.

    ```
    .\install.cmd
    ```

9. Finally, run the program. If all is well, you should see the Thrive Messenger login screen.

    ```
    .\run.cmd
    ```
Note: you can also navigate to the ThriveMessenger folder in Windows Explorer and double click or press Enter on the install.cmd and run.cmd files to run them.

### Compiling

If you wish to compile a binary, run the appropriate compile script. Thrive Messenger can either be compiled with nuitka or PyInstaller.

    ```
    compile_nuitka.cmd
    ```

    ```
    compile_pyinstaller.cmd
    ```

### Compiling on macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)

The repo includes a macOS build script that produces a `.app` zipped archive:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build_macos.sh
scripts/build_macos.sh
```

This writes output archives to `dist-macos/`.

For automated dual-architecture builds, run the GitHub Actions workflow:
`Build macOS Desktop`.
It produces:

- `thrive_messenger-macos-x86_64.zip`
- `thrive_messenger-macos-arm64.zip`

### Running compiled

If you don't feel like fighting with UV and Python, a pre-compiled release is provided.

1. [Download the latest Thrive Messenger release](https://github.com/G4p-Studios/ThriveMessenger/releases/latest/download/thrive_messenger.zip)
2. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice.
3. Navigate to where you extracted the zip file and run tmsg.exe. If your system isn't set up to show file extensions, the filename will just show as tmsg.

Alternatively, you can [download the Thrive Messenger installer](https://github.com/G4p-Studios/ThriveMessenger/releases/latest/download/thrive_messenger_installer.exe) and run through the on-screen prompts to install the program.

As long as you have a PC with Windows 7 or higher, an internet connection and a working sound card, this release should work just fine.

### Login

Logging into your Thrive Messenger account is as simple as logging into your computer's user account.

1.  Enter your username at the Thrive Messenger login screen.
2.  Tab to the password field and enter your Thrive Messenger password.
3.  Optionally, check the boxes to remember your credentials and log in automatically.
4.  Click Login or Press Alt + L to log into Thrive Messenger. A sound will play to tell you that you're logged in.

### The Thrive Messenger UI

When you log into Thrive Messenger, you will land on your contact list. Of course, if your account is brand new, you won't have any contacts to chat with. This list view will show you the name of each contact, as well as their online status. You can navigate your contact list with the up and down arrow keys. Using the Tab key will allow you to navigate the rest of the UI.

*   The block button, accessible with Alt + B, lets you block the focused contact in the list so they can't message you. This is useful if they are being spammy or abusive.
*   The add Contact button, Alt + A, will let you add a new contact. Simply click this button, enter the username of the contact you wish to add, then press Enter.
*   You can either focus on a contact in the list and press Enter to start a chat with them, or tab to and click the Start Chat (Alt + S) button.
* Alt + F will allow you to send a file to the focused contact.
*   You can delete the focused contact with the Delete button or Alt + D.
*   The Use Server Side Commands (Alt + V) button will allow you to perform various server side commands; more on these later.
*   Bot Rules Manager is available from File menu, Settings > Administration, and Server Side Commands. Admins can load, edit, and reset bot rules without editing files manually.
*   Directory can optionally allow direct messaging users on other configured servers. If duplicate usernames exist across servers, the client lets you choose which server user to message and remembers that default.
*   The logout (Alt + O) and exit (Alt + X) buttons are self explanatory.
* The server info button (Alt + I) will show information about the server you're currently logged into.
* Alt + U will allow you to set an online status that your contacts will see. You can choose from a list of preset statuses, such as online, offline and busy, or you can choose a custom one and type a personal message. Server owners can customize the character limit for custom statuses via max_status_length, so check that you have enough characters before you start setting System of a Down lyrics as your status.
* Alt P will check for updates to the program and allow you to auto download them.
* Pressing Alt F4 will minimize the client to the system tray, ready for you to receive messages. Simply double click or press Enter on the Thrive Messenger system tray item to bring it back up.

### Sending and receiving messages

You can start an IM conversation with a contact simply by pressing Enter on them in the contact list. Once you do, you will land on a text field where you can type your message. Pressing Enter will send the message, and pressing Shift + Enter will type a new line. Pressing Shift + Tab once will take you to a checkbox which will allow you to save a permanent log of your chat with the current contact, stored in Documents/ThriveMessenger/chats/<contact>. Pressing Shift + Tab again will show a list of all messages sent and received in the chat. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate this list. To get out of the chat and go back to the main Thrive Messenger window, simply press the Escape key.

### File transfer

As well as sending standard text messages, users can also send files to each other. To send a file, simply highlight the contact you want to send the file to and press Alt + F or click the send file button. A dialog will open where you can choose the file you wish to send. Once you choose your file, the receiving user will get a pop-up message asking if they want to accept the file. Your file will begin sending as soon as the receiver hits yes. Received files are stored in Documents/ThriveMessenger/files.
Note: server owners might place file size limits and certain file type restrictions on users; see below on how to do this yourself.

### Server side commands

If you see (Admin) beside a contact's online status, it means they are classed as a server admin and can perform server side commands from the client. This is what the aforementioned Use Server Side Commands button is for. Clicking the button will bring up a dialog much like the one that appears when you start a chat with a contact. You will auto focus on the command input field. To run a command, simply type it into the field and press Enter.

Each server side command must start with a forward slash (/). The following server side commands are available.

*   /admin username: makes the specified user an admin.
*   /unadmin username: takes the admin user's powers away.
*   /create username password: creates a user account with the specified username and password.
*   /del user: deletes the specified user's account from the server.
*   /ban username date reason: bans the specified user from the server until the specified date (in MM/DD/YYYY format) for the specified reason. Wanna ban someone permanently? Just do what they do on Xbox Live and ban them until December 31st, 9999! Ha ha ha!
*   /unban username: Unbans the specified user.
* /banfile username type date reason: bans the user from sending a certain type of file until a given date. For example, /banfile doglover05 exe 12/31/9999 sending malware. Using a star (*) in the type argument will ban the user from sending files altogether. Using the command without a date will result in a permanent file ban.
* /unbanfile username type: Lifts the user's file ban for the given type. If no type is given, all file bans for the user will be lifted.
* /alert message: Sends a Windows Live style alert message to all online users. For example, /alert The server is about to be shut down for maintenance.
*   /exit: Shuts down the Thrive Messenger server.

Shift Tabbing once from the command input field will show a list of outputs for the commands you've run.

### Bot rules and agent rulesets

Thrive bots can follow a shared agent ruleset loaded from an agent ZIP (for example `/home/devinecr/downloads/*.zip`), and server admins can override rules per bot for their own admin account/server workflow.

Key behavior:

* Global fallback rules are loaded from the configured agent ZIP/file.
* Admin-specific bot rules are seeded from global rules on first use.
* Admins can edit and save their own bot rule override from the client UI.
* Non-admin users can view active bot rules, but cannot edit them.
* Reset action restores a bot back to global seeded rules for that admin scope.

### In-app F1 webview documentation generation

This repo includes an Ollama-based generator for contextual in-app help pages used by F1 dialogs/webviews.

Generate help templates:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_help_docs_with_ollama.py
```

Output:

* `assets/help/help_docs.json`

The app loads these templates at runtime and writes per-context HTML help pages from them.

Those of you familiar with IRC will know that this feature was very much inspired by the concept of server and channel operator commands.

### Sound packs

Sound packs allow you to customise the various sounds Thrive Messenger uses for its events, such as sending and receiving messages, contacts coming online, and logging into the server.
Thrive Messenger ships with 3 sound packs by default.

* Default: Contains a collection of sounds made by blind UK-based musician Andre Louis.
* Galaxia: contains the Galaxia sounds used in the [Thrive Mastodon client](https://github.com/G4p-Studios/Thrive).
* Skype: contains sounds from Skype versions 7 and earlier.

#### Creating sound packs

Structurally, a sound pack is simply a folder with a collection of wave files inside it. To create a sound pack, you will need the following 9 files:

* contact_online
* contact_offline
* login
* logout
* receive
* send
* file_receive
* file_send
* file_error

Make a folder inside Thrive Messenger's sounds folder and paste these files into that folder to create your custom sound pack.

#### Changing sound packs

With the Thrive Messenger client open and logged in, follow these steps to change your sound pack.

1. Press Alt + T to access the settings dialog.
2. Choose a sound pack from the sound pack dropdown menu with the up and down arrow keys.
3. Either press Enter or click the apply button to apply your settings.

### The client.conf file

The client.conf file controls what server and port the Thrive Messenger client connects to. If you have your own Thrive Messenger server up, or you have one that you like to use, you can simply open client.conf in your text editor of choice, such as Notepad++, and modify the server hostname and port to point to your desired server.

The default server is msg.thecubed.cc, running on port 2005.

You can also control update sources in `client.conf`:

```
[updates]
feed_url = https://im.tappedin.fm/updates/latest.json
preferred_repo = Raywonder/ThriveMessenger
fallback_repos = G4p-Studios/ThriveMessenger
```

- `feed_url` is optional. If set, the client checks your hosted feed first.
- If feed lookup fails, the client falls back to GitHub repos in order.
- This allows your custom channel and upstream compatibility at the same time.

### Cron-ready update feed sync

This repo includes `srv/scripts/sync_update_feed.sh` to publish a JSON update feed from GitHub Releases.

Example cron (every 5 minutes):

```
*/5 * * * * /path/to/ThriveMessenger/srv/scripts/sync_update_feed.sh Raywonder/ThriveMessenger /var/www/im.tappedin.fm/updates/latest.json >/var/log/thrive-update-feed.log 2>&1
```

### Auto reading of messages

In the settings dialog accessible with Alt + T, there is an option to have new messages automatically read aloud by your screen reader. This is turned off by default for sighted users.

### The user directory

The user directory, Alt + Y, allows you to quickly find and chat with anyone on your Thrive Messenger server. The user directory is divided into 4 tabs, allowing you to choose between seeing online users, offline users, admins, and the server's entire userbase.

### Offline chats

Think you might have missed messages when you were offline? No problem. When you log back in, the program will check the server for held messages, and if it sees any, will show a dialog asking if you want to see the messages. Clicking yes will show a list of users who sent you messages. Simple press enter on a user to open the chat and see their messages.

### Non-contact chats

Someone sends you a message and they aren't in your contacts. You get to chatting with them for a bit, but then you close the chat to do other things and realise you forgot to add your newfound friend as a contact. This is where the non-contact conversations view comes in. Just like with offline chats, when you open this dialog with Alt C, you will see a list of users who aren't in your contacts but have been chatting with you, allowing you to easily return to the chat and add them if you wish.

## Server usage

### Running the server

The Thrive Messenger server is also written in Python. It is almost standard library, meaning it does not require any external dependencies to run, save for the argon2-cffi library used for hashing passwords.
Note: the server will technically run on both Windows and Linux, but the following instructions are optimised for Linux, so you will need a Linux machine either in the cloud or on your local network.

1. If for some reason git is not installed on your machine, install it with these commands, substituting apt for your distro's package manager.

    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```

2. Clone this repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/G4p-Studios/ThriveMessenger
    ```

3. Navigate to the srv directory inside the repo.

    ```
    cd ThriveMessenger/srv
    ```

4. Install the argon2-cffi library.

    ```
    pip3 install --break-system-packages argon2-cffi
    ```

Note: we aren't actually breaking any packages here, we're just using that argument to stop pip whining about virtual environments.

5. Make a screen session so you're not constantly tied to the terminal when running the server.

    ```
    screen -S thrive
    ```

6. Ensure the server's port is allowed through the firewall.

    ```
    sudo ufw allow 2005
    ```

7. Finally, runn the server.

    ```
    python3 server.py
    ```

8. Detach yourself from the screen session by pressing Control + A, then press D.

Please note: the server will run in unencrypted mode by default, meaning data sent from the client will be sent in plain text. This should only be used for testing servers. In a production environment, you must use valid SSL certificates from a trusted certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt.

### Encrypting the server

Assuming you have a domain or hostname, do the following to enable SSL on your Thrive Messenger server.

1. Use a tool like Certbot to generate your Let's Encrypt certificates. [This guide from the Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=pip) should help with this.
2. In the srv directory of the Thrive Messenger repo, run this command to edit the server's srv.conf file.

    ```
    nano srv.conf
    ```

3. Add these lines to the end of the file, replacing example.com with your actual domain name.

    ```
    certfile=/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
    keyfile=/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
    ```

4. Start the server. It should now say that there's a secure server listening on port <port>.

### Allowing your server to send emails

You can optionally enable SMTP on your Thrive Messenger server to allow account verification and password reset codes to be sent to users by email. Users that create accounts on SMTP-enabled servers are required to supply a valid email address for these features to work.
To allow your server to send emails, simply add these files to the end of your server's srv.conf file, replacing values with those given to you by your email provider.

    ```
    [smtp]
    enabled=true
    server=host.tld
    port=587
    email=your_username@host.tld
    password=your_password
    ```

### File transfer limits

There are 2 config options available for customising file transfer restrictions for users.

* size_limit (bites): files larger than this size cannot be sent. For example, to set the size limit to 2GB, you would do

    ```
    size_limit=2000000000
    ```
.

* blackfiles: a comma-separated blacklist of file extensions that are blocked from sending by default. For example:

    ```
    blackfiles=exe,bat,cmd,app,vbs
    ```
.
