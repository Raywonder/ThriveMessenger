## Review notes

Thrive Messenger is a client for compatible Thrive Messenger servers. The default server is `im.tappedin.fm` on TLS port 2005. Accounts, room permissions, moderation, retention, file limits, and optional features are controlled by the connected server.

Testers may add and sign in to an existing compatible Thrive Messenger server that they use or administer. Testers who do not already have access to a server are welcome to use the TappedIn test service. They may also contact us through the support methods listed for this testing version to request a hosted Thrive Messenger server that we can configure for them to administer. Server hosting and configuration are optional; the client can connect to compatible independently hosted servers.

This build is free and has no advertising, in-app purchases, subscriptions, or external purchase links. It does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. Voice audio is sent only while a user is in an active direct or group call. The default TappedIn server relays call audio to current participants and does not intentionally retain call audio. Self-hosted server operators publish and control their own policies.

Provide a dedicated App Review username and password before submission. The account must be able to sign in, view contacts, join a test room, send a direct and room message, and enter a voice room. Do not place review credentials in public source control.

## TestFlight beta description

Thrive Messenger is an accessible client for direct messaging, group rooms, file sharing, moderation, and voice conversations on compatible Thrive Messenger servers.

To test the app, add and sign in to an existing Thrive Messenger server that you use or administer. If you do not have a server, you are welcome to use our TappedIn test service. You may also contact us through the support methods provided for this beta to request a hosted Thrive Messenger server. We can configure the hosted server so you can administer it and test server-management features. Using a hosted server is optional; Thrive Messenger also supports compatible independently hosted servers.

When reporting feedback, include the app version, iOS or iPadOS version, server hostname, the action you were performing, and the exact accessible error wording. Do not include passwords, passkeys, private keys, or complete authentication tokens.

## App privacy questionnaire baseline

Answer **Yes** to data collection for the default TappedIn service. Declare only data actually processed by the app/service:

- Contact info: email address, if supplied during account creation or recovery; linked to identity; app functionality and account management.
- User content: messages and files; linked to identity; app functionality and moderation/safety.
- Identifiers: username/account identifier; linked to identity; app functionality and account management.
- Usage data: room membership, presence, and server activity needed to operate and protect the service; linked to identity; app functionality, security, and moderation.
- Diagnostics: server-side connection/error records when retained; potentially linked to identity; app functionality and security.
- Audio data: voice audio is processed transiently to provide a live call and is not intentionally retained by the default service. Confirm Apple questionnaire treatment at submission time.

For all categories: not used for third-party advertising, developer advertising, or tracking. No data broker sale. Independent self-hosted servers are separate operators with their own policies.

## Age-rating and compliance baseline

- User-generated content and messaging: present.
- Parental controls: not built into this client.
- Age assurance: not built into this client.
- Advertising: none.
- Gambling, loot boxes, contests, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, medical content, horror, violence, sexual content, or profanity supplied by the developer: none.
- Users could transmit mature or objectionable content: yes; server moderation, blocking, room roles, and server policies apply.
- Unrestricted web access: no embedded general-purpose web browser.
- Encryption/export compliance: the app uses Apple Network framework TLS and Apple system cryptography for transport; no proprietary encryption implementation is shipped. Complete Apple’s exemption questions consistently and retain the annual self-classification record if Apple requires one.

## Submission gates

- Dedicated private App Review account and stable review room.
- Physical-device direct/group voice test between iOS and desktop.
- VoiceOver focus, labels, dynamic type, contrast, and keyboard test.
- Screenshots captured from the final UI without private account data.
- App Store Connect build reaches `VALID`.
- Privacy questionnaire reviewed against the live default-server retention configuration.
- In-app account deletion verified against the default server, including confirmation, session/passkey revocation, and unlinking locally stored SSO identities without deleting external provider accounts.
- EU DSA trader status verified by the Account Holder/Admin using real display contact information and supporting documentation.
